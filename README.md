# Cladogram-Maker
A simple, light weight tool to make cladograms and phylogenetic trees

This program lets you easily create an evolutionary, family or phylogenetic tree. By clicking anywhere on the screen, you can write text for the name of something on the tree. By pressing ctrl+l you can enter into link mode. This puts 4 small circles around all your names so you can create a line between two names by clicking two circles. This will also put the names in the right place on the screen.
